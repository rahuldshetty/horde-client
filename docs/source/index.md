Through this library package, it will provide easier access to Horde services through simple Python API clients.

## Features

* Simple & Easy-to-use
* Support for Text Generation & Image Generation (WIP)
* Asynchronous Client
* LangChain Integration (WIP)

```{admonition} Note
:class: note
There is an official [Python SDK](https://github.com/Haidra-Org/horde-sdk.git) under development from Haidra-org.

By default, access tp public Horde services are disabled by to ensure Security against accidental data leaks.

You can enable access to the official client by enabled `insecure` mode. Check out [Quickstart](01_quickstart.md) for more details.
